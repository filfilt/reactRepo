Part11.Component
 ---------------
Components let you split the i7i into independent,
reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
When building your React application you will have
many different components that make up your React
application. Some will likely have state changes and may
even have to access your backend. Other components
may just render a piece of your UI with access to props
to render successfully.

    State full component
The above is an example of a
stateful component, why? Three
things,
1. we first initialize state,
2. secondly we have methods on
our constructor, and lastly
3. we setState within our
handleChange method.
These are three critical pieces of a
stateful component.
--------------/----------------
	Stateless component
This is stateless component, its just simply returning a p tag that will have the
value of our input as we type.
*It is not setting any state,
*there are no methods.
This is a great way to keep your react code maintainable and readable. Breaking
it up into smaller components and passing props to child components. We export
this component and include it is the parent component. Its only job is to display the
value from the input.

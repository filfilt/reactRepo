      What is React?
React is a front-end library developed by Facebook. It is used for
handling the view layer for web and mobile apps.
ReactJS allows us to create reusable UI components. It is currently

ReactJS is JavaScript library used for building reusable UI
components. According to React official documentation,
following is the definition â€”
React is a library for building composable user interfaces.
It encourages the creation of reusable UI components, which
present data that changes over time. Lots of people use React
as the V in MVC.
React abstracts away the DOM from you, offering a simpler
programming model and better performance. React can also
render on the server using Node, and it can power native apps
using React Native. React implements one-way reactive data
flow, which reduces the boilerplate and is easier to reason
about than traditional data binding.

- One Html Page        =>That is why we called single page app
- One or more CSS File     =>To format and style a page or components
- One or more JavaScnpt files =>To performclient side logic

- Content => Assets and reference files

HTML:

Relatin:
	App.js ->app->index.js then index.js->root->index.html
	newConp -><newComp></newComp>->App.js ->app->index.js then index.js->root->index.html
